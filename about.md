# 自由软件的拥护者

I have to admit that it's hard to get started using *Free Software*,

also, fsf is not prevalent to used for work or creation.

However, free software has significant implications for breaking monopolies and closures.

Let's get started.

# 软件极简主义 (Minimalism)

Are you be tired of bloated commercial software?

Those software that's overloaded with features you'll never use and littered with ads.

So, **in order to keep our mind clean. Start to use Arch Linux and free software**

*Keep you attention in one thing*
